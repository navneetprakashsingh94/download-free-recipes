Here is the list of my top 10 coconut recipies. Let me know in the comments below what's your favourite coconut recipe. :

1. **Coconut Curry**: Coconut milk is often used as a base for creamy and flavorful curries in Southeast Asian cuisines, such as Thai, Indian, and Malaysian. Coconut curry can be made with a variety of proteins like chicken, shrimp, or tofu, and vegetables, along with aromatic spices and herbs.

2. **Coconut Rice**: Coconut rice is a fragrant and slightly sweet dish made by cooking rice in coconut milk instead of water. It is a popular side dish in many tropical countries and pairs well with spicy or savory main courses.

3. **Coconut Shrimp**: Coconut shrimp is a popular appetizer or main dish made by coating shrimp in a mixture of shredded coconut and breadcrumbs, then frying or baking until crispy. It is often served with a sweet and tangy dipping sauce.

4. **Coconut Chutney**: Coconut chutney is a condiment commonly served with South Indian dishes like dosas, idlis, and vadas. It is made by blending grated coconut with spices, herbs, and sometimes yogurt or tamarind to create a flavorful and creamy sauce.

5. **Coconut Flan**: Coconut flan is a tropical twist on the classic caramel custard dessert. It is made by combining coconut milk with eggs, sugar, and vanilla, then baking it in a water bath until set. The result is a creamy and luscious dessert with a hint of coconut flavor.

6. **Coconut Ceviche**: Coconut ceviche is a refreshing and vibrant dish made with diced fish or seafood marinated in lime juice, coconut milk, and spices. It is often served with diced vegetables, herbs, and avocado for added freshness and texture.

7. **Coconut Pancakes**: Coconut pancakes are light and fluffy pancakes made with coconut milk or shredded coconut in the batter. They can be enjoyed for breakfast or brunch, topped with fresh fruit, maple syrup, or a dollop of coconut whipped cream.

8. **Coconut Ice Cream**: Coconut ice cream is a dairy-free alternative to traditional ice cream made with coconut milk or cream. It has a rich and creamy texture with a tropical coconut flavor, making it a refreshing treat on a hot day.

9. **Coconut-Crusted Fish**: Coconut-crusted fish is a flavorful and crispy dish made by coating fish fillets in a mixture of shredded coconut and breadcrumbs, then baking or frying until golden brown. It is often served with a side of mango salsa or coconut rice.

10. **Coconut Macaroons**: Coconut macaroons are sweet and chewy cookies made with shredded coconut, egg whites, sugar, and sometimes flour or almond meal. They are often dipped in chocolate or drizzled with caramel for extra indulgence.
