Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that isn't good for health. Consuming it in large amount can be detrimental and can lead to alcohol poisoning. Alcohol misuse is related to increased risk of mental disorder and can effect the mental well being of a person. So try this alternative and tell me in the comment what you think about it. Here are a few alternative that I've tasted. Give it a try next time if you have a choice:

1. **Mocktails**: Mocktails are non-alcoholic cocktails made with a combination of fruit juices, flavored syrups, herbs, and soda water. They come in a variety of flavors and can be just as flavorful and refreshing as traditional cocktails without the alcohol content.

2. **Sparkling Water**: Sparkling water or soda water is a popular non-alcoholic beverage that comes in a variety of flavors. It provides the carbonation and fizziness of soda without the added sugars or alcohol. You can enjoy it plain or flavored with a splash of fruit juice or syrup.

3. **Herbal Tea**: Herbal teas are caffeine-free and can be enjoyed hot or cold. There are many herbal tea blends available, ranging from soothing chamomile and peppermint to fruity hibiscus and citrusy lemongrass. Herbal teas are hydrating and can be a comforting alternative to alcoholic drinks.

4. **Kombucha**: Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage that contains probiotics and beneficial acids. It has a slightly tangy flavor and can be found in a variety of fruity or herbal flavors. Kombucha is often enjoyed for its potential health benefits and can be a flavorful alternative to alcoholic drinks.

5. **Fruit Juices and Smoothies**: Freshly squeezed fruit juices and smoothies are delicious and nutritious alternatives to alcoholic beverages. You can mix and match different fruits and vegetables to create your own custom blends. Smoothies can be made with yogurt or non-dairy milk for added creaminess.

6. **Non-Alcoholic Beer and Wine**: Non-alcoholic beer and wine are specially brewed or fermented to remove most or all of the alcohol content. They come in a variety of styles and flavors and can provide a similar taste experience to their alcoholic counterparts without the intoxicating effects.

7. **Sparkling Juice**: Sparkling juice is a non-alcoholic alternative to champagne or sparkling wine. It is made from fruit juice that has been carbonated to create bubbles and fizziness. Sparkling juice is often served at celebrations and special occasions as a festive and refreshing beverage.

8. **Cold Brew Coffee or Iced Tea**: Cold brew coffee and iced tea are popular non-alcoholic beverages that can be enjoyed for their refreshing taste and caffeine boost. Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period, while iced tea is made by steeping tea leaves in cold water and chilling.

9. **Coconut Water**: Coconut water is a natural and hydrating beverage that is low in calories and rich in electrolytes. It has a slightly sweet and nutty flavor and can be enjoyed plain or mixed with fruit juice for added flavor.

10. **Infused Water**: Infused water is made by adding fruits, vegetables, herbs, or spices to water and allowing them to infuse their flavors. It's a simple and refreshing way to stay hydrated and can be customized with your favorite ingredients.
