Middle eastern cusine has a diverse set of ingrdients reflecting the region's long history and culinary traditions. It is highly influenced by a variety of cultures and civilizations that have inhabited the region over millennia, including ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, and the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Middle Eastern dishes often feature a blend of flavors and ingredients from different cultural traditions. Here are my favourite dishes that I came across from Middle eastern food. Let me know in the comments below about what you think:

1. **Hummus:**
   A classic dip made from blended chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Hummus is often garnished with paprika and served with pita bread.

2. **Falafel:**
   Deep-fried patties or balls made from ground chickpeas or fava beans, seasoned with herbs and spices. Falafel is commonly served in pita bread with tahini sauce and vegetables.

3. **Tabbouleh:**
   A refreshing Lebanese salad made with finely chopped parsley, tomatoes, mint, onions, and soaked bulgur, dressed in olive oil and lemon juice.

4. **Shawarma:**
   Grilled or spit-roasted meat, often chicken, beef, or lamb, sliced and served in flatbread with tahini, garlic sauce, and vegetables.

5. **Baba Ganoush:**
   A smoky dip made from roasted and mashed eggplant mixed with tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. It's served with pita bread or as part of a mezze platter.

6. **Moussaka:**
   A layered casserole dish found in Middle Eastern and Greek cuisines, Moussaka typically features eggplant, minced meat (often lamb or beef), tomatoes, and b√©chamel sauce.

7. **Kebabs:**
   Skewered and grilled meats, such as kebabs made with chunks of marinated lamb, beef, or chicken. They are often served with rice or flatbread.

8. **Dolma:**
   Grape leaves stuffed with a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and herbs. Dolma can be vegetarian or include meat, and they are often served with yogurt.

9. **Labneh:**
   A strained yogurt cheese, Labneh is thick and creamy, often drizzled with olive oil and served as a spread or dip for bread.

10. **Kunafa:**
    A popular Middle Eastern dessert, Kunafa consists of thin noodle-like pastry soaked in sweet syrup and layered with nuts or cheese. It's often enjoyed during festive occasions.
