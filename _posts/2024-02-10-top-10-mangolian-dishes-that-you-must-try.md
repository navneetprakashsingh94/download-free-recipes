On my recent trip to Mangolia, I was given the option to either have my regular food or try the Mangolian cuisine. Here are a few of the dishes I tried, have a look, let me know in the comments below what's your favourite Mangolian dish. What I leanred from the Mangolian cusine is that it's deeply rooted in the nomadic lifestyle of the Mongolian people, who historically relied on animal husbandry and herding for sustenance. Traditional Mongolian diet consisted primarily of meat, dairy products, and staple grains. In the modern world, these dishes have evolved substantially. Here are a few dishes I tried:

1. **Mongolian Beef**: Thinly sliced beef stir-fried with green onions, garlic, ginger, and a savory-sweet sauce made with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and brown sugar.

2. **Buuz**: Mongolian dumplings filled with minced meat (often mutton or beef) mixed with onions and spices, then steamed.

3. **Khuushuur**: Fried meat pastry similar to buuz but with a crispy fried dough exterior.

4. **Khorkhog**: A traditional Mongolian stew made with mutton or goat meat, potatoes, carrots, and onions, cooked with hot stones in a sealed container.

5. **Tsagaan id√©e**: Literally meaning "white food," this dish consists of boiled meat (typically mutton), buuz, dairy products like yogurt or cheese, and sometimes rice or noodles.

6. **Bantan**: A hearty soup made with boiled mutton, rice, and vegetables like carrots, onions, and potatoes.

7. **Boortsog**: Deep-fried dough pastries often enjoyed as a snack or dessert, sometimes drizzled with honey.

8. **Tsuiwan**: A noodle soup made with hand-pulled noodles, meat (commonly beef or mutton), and vegetables in a flavorful broth.

9. **Byaslag**: A traditional Mongolian cheese made from yak or cow milk, often served alongside bread or dried curds.

10. **Airag**: Fermented mare's milk, a traditional Mongolian beverage enjoyed for its tangy flavor and slight fizziness.
